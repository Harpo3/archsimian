Currently a work in process...

Improve management of a music library built with MediaMonkey 4 (MM4) for Windows by integrating MM4 database data with an Arch Linux program. Adds more advanced playlist building features than MM4 currently offers, specifically to better control variety and frequency of play than MM4â€™s smart playlists provides. Users will then import the improved playlists back into MM4 for use in Windows or to sync with mobile devices using the MM4 for Android App. They will also be able to use the same playlists in Audacious or other Linux-based media players, using a shared music library.
